    The current implementation of PEP 517 in pip always does builds in an
    isolated temporary directory. This causes problems with the build, because
    Cargo.toml necessarily refers to the current version of pyo3 by a relative
    path.
    Since these sdists are never meant to be used for anything other than
    tox / pip installs, at sdist build time, we will modify the Cargo.toml
    in the sdist archive to include an *absolute* path to pyo3.
